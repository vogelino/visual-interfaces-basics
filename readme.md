# Visual interfaces basics
A review and report of the course [_Visual interfaces basics_](https://fhp.incom.org/workspace/6272/1) given by [Prof. Constanze Langer](http://www.fh-potsdam.de/person/person-action/constanze-langer/show/Person/) [@FH-Potsdam](fh-potsdam.de) in the winter semester 2015/1. By [Lucas Vogel](http://www.vogelino.com).

## The course
> “In Interface design, a good visual perception is still very important. Even if many innovation has happened in the multi-modal interaction fields, the main interface between humans and machines remains the screen - in all sizes and characteristics. This field of expertise presents graphic and semiotic questions based for instance on time or interaction, situating formal-aesthetics interactive systems in the focal point.”

— Constanze Langer. Traduced from german by Lucas Vogel


In this course we did:

- get an overview over the human perception, especially the visual perception
- get an overview over the multiple presentation possibilities of interface elements, data, relations and processes
- analyze the existing communication systems, sorting and structuring methods
- develop our personal design approach, both analog and digital
- become aware of the multiple design aspects that are to be used when designing interfaces
- practice with exercises, achieving results, using processes and making decisions which we were able to to justify and explain, making it logical and comprehensive

## The interface
To investigate theoretically and practically the concepts and basics of Interface design, every student chose one product with a display in order to analyze its streghts and weaknesses and to understand its structure and its interactions.

I chose my home thermostat from Junkers, which controls my flat's heater, which is nice. However, the apparatus is quite confusing for many reasons. Before taking part of this course, I barely understood how it works and how set it up. I was rather touching every button until the temperature in my flat became at some point convenient. I ended up changing the configuration every day when actually, the purpose of the thermostat itself should be to handle the heating for me once configured.

### The confusing parts
The three modes of the thermostat were not really clear to me at the beginning, as to switch between them, a combination of many different physical inputs are necessary:

- **The off mode:** The off mode is actually an anti-freeze mode that heats only when the room temperature goes under 5°c. It is activated when the circular switch is oriented on the ![snowflake icon][snowflake-icon] symbol. For any user having few knowledge about heating system, it would take a while util realizing that this symbol turns the thermostat _"off"_
- **The heating programm:** The thermostat leaves the user the possibility to configure two phases of heating during the day: The day phase and the night phase. When the user sets up the day phase, he can choose at what time the mode begins and the temperature the room should be starting from this point. The day phase is represented by a ![sun icon][sun-icon] icon and marks the end of the night phase. The night phase is represented by a ![moon icon][moon-icon] and marks the end of the day phase. What here is confusing, is:
	- that in the night phase it cannot be heated at higher temperature than in the day phase
	- that the day phase can be configured to heat during the night and the night phase during the day
	- that the text shown when configuring the day phase is _"heat"_ when in the night phase it is _"save"_

	To let the heating programm run, the circular switch needs to be oriented on the ![radiator icon][radiator-icon]. It is important that the _"auto"_ text apears on the screen. To toggle the _"auto"_ text, the auto button has to be pressed.

- **The manual mode:** This mode lets the user override the temperature of the actual heating phase and set the one he wants right now. To do so, he must press the auto button until it does not appear on the sreen. Then, by rotating the central rotative knob the user can set the wished temperature. This is also annoying at the first time because you can easlily miss the information and heat for many days non stop.
