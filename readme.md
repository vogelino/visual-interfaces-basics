# Visual interfaces basics
A review and report of the course [_Visual interfaces basics_](https://fhp.incom.org/workspace/6272/1) given by [Prof. Constanze Langer](http://www.fh-potsdam.de/person/person-action/constanze-langer/show/Person/) [@FH-Potsdam](fh-potsdam.de) in the winter semester 2015/1. By [Lucas Vogel](http://www.vogelino.com).

## The course
> “In Interface design, a good visual perception is still very important. Even if many innovation has happened in the multi-modal interaction fields, the main interface between humans and machines remains the screen - in all sizes and characteristics. This field of expertise presents graphic and semiotic questions based for instance on time or interaction, situating formal-aesthetics interactive systems in the focal point.”

— Constanze Langer. Traduced from german by Lucas Vogel


In this course we did:

- get an overview over the human perception, especially the visual perception
- get an overview over the multiple presentation possibilities of interface elements, data, relations and processes
- analyze the existing communication systems, sorting and structuring methods
- develop our personal design approach, both analog and digital
- become aware of the multiple design aspects that are to be used when designing interfaces
- practice with exercises, achieving results, using processes and making decisions which we were able to to justify and explain, making it logical and comprehensive

## The interface
To investigate theoretically and practically the concepts and basics of Interface design, every student chose one product with a display that is whether well or badly designed.

I chose my home thermostat from Junkers, which controls all my heating systems, which is nice. However, the apparatus is quite confusing for many reasons. Before taking part of this course, I barely understood how it works and how set it up. I was rather touching every button until the temperature in my flat became at some point convenient. I ended up changing the configuration every day when actually, the purpose of the thermostat itself should be to handle the heating for me once configured.
